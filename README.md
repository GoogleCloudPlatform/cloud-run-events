# Cloud Run Events

Cloud Run Events builds on Kubernetes to enable easy consumption of events from
Google Cloud services. It can be useful independently, or mixed with
[Knative](https://knative.dev).

To get started, [install Cloud Run Events](./docs/install/README.md).

Then use one of the implemented resources,

- [PubSubSource.events.cloud.run/v1alpha1](./docs/pubsubsource/README.md)

The sources are implemented to bridge events from Google Cloud and translate
that into an HTTP POST to a `service` or `addressable` of your choosing;
outbound Event is in [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) format.
