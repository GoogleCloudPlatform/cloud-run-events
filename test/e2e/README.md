# E2E Tests

Prow will run `./e2e-tests.sh`.

## Adding E2E Tests

E2E tests are tagged with `// +build e2e` but tagging a Go file this way will
prevent the compiler from compiling the test code. To work around this, for the
test code we separate them into different files:

```shell
test/e2e
├── e2e_test.go
└── test_xxx.go
```

- `e2e_test.go` is the testing file entry point (tagged with e2e).
- `test_xxx.go` are the test implementations (not tagged with e2e).

We leverage the
[test library in Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/master/test/lib)
as much as possible for implementing the e2e tests. Logic specific to
knative-gcp should be added under [knative-gcp e2e test lib](lib).

## Running E2E Tests on an existing cluster

To run [the e2e tests](../e2e) with `go test` command, you need to have a
running environment that meets
[the e2e test environment requirements](#environment-requirements), and you need
to specify the build tag `e2e`.

```shell
go test --tags=e2e ./test/e2e/...
```

And count is supported too:

```shell
go test --tags=e2e ./test/e2e/... --count=3
```

If you want to run a specific test:

```shell
go test --tags=e2e ./test/e2e/... -run NameOfTest
```

For example, to run TestPullSubscription:

```shell
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to json creds file> \
E2E_PROJECT_ID=<project name> \
  go test --tags=e2e ./test/e2e/... -run TestPullSubscription
```

Note that if you plan on running metrics-related E2E tests using the StackDriver
backend, you need to give your
[Service Account](../../docs/install/pubsub-service-account.md) the
`Monitoring Editor` role on your Google Cloud project:

```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member=serviceAccount:cloudrunevents-pullsub@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/monitoring.editor
```

## Environment requirements

There's couple of things you need to install before running e2e tests locally.

1. A running Kubernetes cluster with [knative-gcp](../../docs/install) installed
   and configured
1. A docker repo containing [the test images](#test-images)

## Test images

### Building the test images

_Note: this is only required when you run e2e tests locally with `go test`
commands. Running tests through e2e-tests.sh will publish the images
automatically._

The [`upload-test-images.sh`](./../upload-test-images.sh) script can be used to
build and push the test images used by the e2e tests. It requires:

- [`KO_DOCKER_REPO`](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#environment-setup)
  to be set
- You need to be
  [authenticated with your `KO_DOCKER_REPO`](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#environment-setup)
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to be installed

To run the script for all end to end test images:

```bash
./test/upload-test-images.sh ./test/test_images
./test/upload-test-images.sh ./vendor/knative.dev/eventing/test/test_images/
```

For images deployed in GCR, a docker tag is mandatory to avoid issues with using
`latest` tag:

```bash
./test/upload-test-images.sh ./test/test_images e2e
./test/upload-test-images.sh ./vendor/knative.dev/eventing/test/test_images/ e2e
```

### Adding new test images

New test images should be placed in `./test/test_images`. For each image create
a new sub-folder and include a Go file that will be an entry point to the
application. This Go file should use the package `main` and include the function
`main()`. It is a good practice to include a `README` file as well. When
uploading test images, `ko` will build an image from this folder and upload to
the Docker repository configured as
[`KO_DOCKER_REPO`](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#environment-setup).
