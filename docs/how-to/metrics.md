# Accessing Metrics in Stackdriver

## Enable the Metrics API

In cloud console, navigate to Monitoring -> Metrics explorer. Enable the montoring metrics API and add your project
to a workspace (or create a new workspace).

## Add the Monitoring Metric Writer Role to the Dataplane Service Account

```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member=serviceAccount:cre-dataplane@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/monitoring.metricWriter
```

## Enable Metrics in the `config-observability` ConfigMap

Edit the `config-observability` ConfigMap under the `cloud-run-events` namespace in Cloud Console or with the following
`kubectl` command:

```shell
kubectl edit configmap -n cloud-run-events config-observability
```

and add the following entries:

```
metrics.backend-destination: stackdriver
metrics.stackdriver-project-id: "<your stackdriver project id>" # Replace with your project's ID.
metrics.reporting-period-seconds: "60"
```

## Accessing metrics in Cloud Console

Navigate to
[`Monitoring > Metrics explorer`](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer) and build a query to
see metrics. An example query would look like:

-   Resource type: `Cloud run for Anthos Broker`  
    Metric: `Broker event count`  
    Filter: `project_id="<your_project_id">`  
    Aggregator: `sum`

A graphical view should be displayed on canvas as the query result. The graph can be viewed in different formats like
Line, Stacked Bar, Stacked Area, Heatmap, depending on the aggregator.
