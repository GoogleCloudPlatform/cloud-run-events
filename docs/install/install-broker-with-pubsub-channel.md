# Installing Broker with Pub/Sub Channel

In Knative Eventing, a Broker represents an "event mesh". Events are sent to the Broker's ingress and are then sent to any
subscribers that are interested in that event. Brokers are currently backed by a configurable Channel.
In this guide, we show an example of how to configure a Broker backed by the Pub/Sub Channel.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Knative-GCP](./install-knative-gcp.md). Remember to install [Knative Eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/).

1. [Create a Pub/Sub enabled Service Account](./pubsub-service-account.md).

## Deployment

1.  Patch the configmap in the `knative-eventing` namespace to use the Pub/Sub `Channel` as the [default channel](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/channels/default-channels/) with [patch-default-ch-config-with-pubsub.yaml](./patch-default-ch-config-with-pubsub.yaml).

    ```shell
    kubectl patch configmap default-ch-webhook -n knative-eventing --patch "$(cat patch-default-ch-config-with-pubsub.yaml)"
    ```

1. Add the `knative-eventing-injection` label to your namespace with the following command.

    ```shell
    kubectl label namespace default knative-eventing-injection=enabled
    ```

   This triggers a reconciliation process that creates the `default Broker` in that namespace.

1. Verify that the `Broker` is running

    ```shell
    kubectl --namespace default get broker default
    ```

   This shows the `Broker` that you created:

    ```shell
    NAME      READY   REASON   URL                                                        AGE
    default   True             http://default-broker.event-example.svc.cluster.local      1m
    ```

    When the `Broker` has the `READY=True` state, it can start processing any events it receives.
