# Installing Pub/Sub Enabled Service Account

Besides the control plane setup described in the general [installation guide](./README.md), each of our resources have a
data plane component, which basically needs permissions to read and/or write to Pub/Sub. Herein, we show the steps needed
to configure such Pub/Sub enabled Service Account.
   
1.  Create a
    [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
    and install the `gcloud` CLI and run `gcloud auth login`. This sample will
    use a mix of `gcloud` and `kubectl` commands. The rest of the sample assumes
    that you've set the `$PROJECT_ID` environment variable to your Google Cloud
    project id, and also set your project ID as default using
    `gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID`.

1.  Enable the `Cloud Pub/Sub API` on your project:

    ```shell
    gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
    ```

1.  Create a
    [Google Cloud Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/project) to interact with 
    Pub/Sub. In general, we would just need permissions to receive messages (`roles/pubsub.subscriber`). 
    However, in the case of the `Channel`, we would also need the ability to publish messages (`roles/pubsub.publisher`). 
    
    1.  Create a new Service Account named `cre-pubsub` with the
        following command:

        ```shell
        gcloud iam service-accounts create cre-pubsub
        ```

    1.  Give that Service Account the necessary permissions on your project.
    
        In this example, and for the sake of simplicity, we will just grant `roles/pubsub.editor` privileges to the Service
        Account, which encompasses both of the above plus some other permissions. Note that if you prefer finer-grained
        privileges, you can just grant the ones mentioned above.        

        ```shell
        gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
          --member=serviceAccount:cre-pubsub@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
          --role roles/pubsub.editor
        ```

    1.  Download a new JSON private key for that Service Account. **Be sure not
        to check this key into source control!**

        ```shell
        gcloud iam service-accounts keys create cre-pubsub.json \
        --iam-account=cre-pubsub@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
        ```

    1.  Create a secret on the Kubernetes cluster with the downloaded key. Remember to create the secret in the namespace 
        your resources will reside. The example below does so in the `default` namespace.

        ```shell
        kubectl --namespace default create secret generic google-cloud-key --from-file=key.json=cre-pubsub.json
        ```

        `google-cloud-key` and `key.json` are default values expected by our resources.

## Cleaning Up

1. Delete the secret

    ```shell
    kubectl --namespace default delete secret google-cloud-key
    ```
1. Delete the service account

    ```shell
    gcloud iam service-accounts delete cre-pubsub@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```
